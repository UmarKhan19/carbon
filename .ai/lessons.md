## Permission scope renames are invisible to typecheck

**Context:** Renaming DB RLS policies (e.g., `plm_*` → `production_*`) as part of a module rename.

**Problem:** The app layer's `requirePermissions()` and `permissions.can()` calls use string literals like `"plm"`. These are invisible to TypeScript's type checker and linter — the rename passes all automated checks but 403s every route at runtime.

**Rule:** When renaming permission scopes, grep the ENTIRE codebase for all string literal references, not just the DB layer. Check `requirePermissions`, `permissions.can`, `usePermissions`, route loaders, and any conditional UI gating.

**Applies to:** Any permission or scope rename, `apps/erp/app/routes/`, `apps/erp/app/modules/`.

## Multi-tenancy: every query must scope by companyId

**Context:** Writing service functions that query the database.

**Problem:** Forgetting to include `.eq("companyId", companyId)` in a query exposes cross-tenant data. RLS provides a safety net, but defense in depth requires application-level scoping too.

**Rule:** Every database query in a service function MUST include `companyId` scoping. Never rely solely on RLS for tenant isolation — treat it as a backup, not the primary guard.

**Applies to:** All `*.service.ts` files, any Kysely or Supabase query.

## ValidatedForm needs the validator, not the raw schema

**Context:** Building forms with zod validation.

**Problem:** Passing a raw zod schema to `ValidatedForm` instead of wrapping it with `validator()` from `@carbon/form` results in silent validation failures — the form submits without client-side validation.

**Rule:** Always use `validator(schema)` from `@carbon/form`, not the raw zod schema. Validate with `validator(schema).validate(formData)`, not `schema.parse()`.

**Applies to:** All forms in `apps/erp/app/routes/`, `packages/form/`.

## Features live inside existing permission modules

**Context:** Building a new feature that belongs to an existing domain (e.g., assembly instructions within production).

**Problem:** Creating a standalone module enum value / permission family (`Assembly` module with `assembly_*` permissions) for something that is really part of an existing domain. Assembly instructions belong to **production**, governed by `production_<view|create|update|delete>`.

**Rule:** Don't invent a new module/permission family for a feature that fits an existing domain. Add a sub-link in the existing sidebar group (like Procedures) and a full-screen editor in its own route tree (`x+/assembly+/$id`, `handle.module: "production"`, mirroring `x+/procedure+/`). Pattern: list route under `x+/<module>+/<plural>.tsx`, full-screen editor in a sibling `x+/<singular>+/` tree whose `_layout.tsx` declares the parent module. Module folder = permission module = nav module.

**Applies to:** New features under `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/`, `apps/erp/app/modules/`.

## Assembly viewer camera + animation principles

**Context:** Camera transitions and part-motion animation in the assembly instruction viewer (`packages/viewer`).

**Problem:** Per-step re-zooming and pure-geometry view heuristics lose the "where are we on the model" context; small fasteners are invisible at assembly scale; sparse path sampling produced false "removable" results (washer/bolt ordering bugs).

**Rule (user directives):**
- **Constant zoom, rotate-only:** per-step camera transitions keep the standing whole-assembly distance and only rotate toward the action — never re-zoom per step or frame a single small part tightly.
- **Occlusion-aware angles:** choose view direction by scoring how many parts block the line of sight to the animated part (seated pose + travel midpoint), not by pure geometry heuristics.
- **Exaggerate small parts:** bolts/washers get display-only exaggerated travel (>=2.5x their size) so insertions read at assembly scale.
- **Manual motion editing is a 0.001% escape hatch:** keep it collapsed behind "Edit manually"; motions come from the geometry planner.
- **Planner correctness beats coverage:** cap sample spacing (2mm) rather than sample count. Threaded fasteners need a thread-depth penetration allowance along their own axis because CAD models them as interfering solid cylinders.

**Applies to:** `packages/viewer/`, geometry planner (`services/geometry`).
